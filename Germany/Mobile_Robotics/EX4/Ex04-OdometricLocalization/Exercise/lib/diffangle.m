%DIFFANGLE  Take difference of two angles and unwrap it.%   DELTA = DIFFANGLE(ALPHA,BETA) computes ALPHA minus BETA and unwraps the%   result such that DELTA is the minimal difference angle.%%   If ALPHA and BETA are vectors of equal length, A is the vector of%   angular differences. If either ALPHA and BETA is Inf, Inf is returned.%%   See also SETANGLETORANGE.% v.1.0, Apr. 2008, Kai Arras, Evolution Robotics, Inc.function delta = diffangle(a1,a2)delta = normangle(a1-a2, -pi);
